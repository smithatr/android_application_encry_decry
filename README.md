**TITLE:** *"Rail Fence Cipher Algorithm for Message Encryption and Decryption on Android"*

**METHODOLOGY:**  
The **Rail Fence Cipher** algorithm is implemented in an **Android** application developed using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The algorithm works by encrypting a message into a zigzag pattern across a predefined number of rails, and then reordering the characters according to this pattern. In the decryption phase, the process is reversed to reconstruct the original message. The application allows users to easily encrypt and decrypt messages on their mobile devices, providing a simple yet effective encryption technique for secure communication.

**SOFTWARE TOOLS:**  
- **Programming Language:** Kotlin  
- **Development Platform:** Android Studio for app development  
- **Encryption Technique:** Rail Fence Cipher Algorithm  

**CONCLUSION:**  
This project enables secure message encryption and decryption on mobile devices using the **Rail Fence Cipher**, providing a hands-on example of classical encryption in modern applications. It demonstrates how basic cryptographic techniques can be applied in Android development for personal or educational use.

**INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION:**  
- **Mobile Security:** Encrypting sensitive information in mobile applications for secure communication.  
- **Learning Tools:** Teaching encryption algorithms and cryptography concepts in mobile development courses.  

**SOCIETAL APPLICATION:**  
- **Personal Privacy:** Ensuring that users' messages remain secure from unauthorized access in personal applications.  
- **Educational Use:** Helping students and enthusiasts learn about cryptography by implementing basic encryption techniques on mobile platforms.
